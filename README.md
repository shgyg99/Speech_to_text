# Speech-to-Text with Transformer ModelðŸŽ™

This repository contains a Speech-to-Text model trained on the **LJ Speech Dataset**. The model utilizes:
- **CNN Feature Extractor** for extracting audio features.
- **Positional Encoding** to handle sequential data.
- **Transformer Architecture** for accurate transcription.

The project includes a web application deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** and instructions for running the app using Docker.
